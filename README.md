# OpenGL training

This is just the projects that I've done to learn own to use OpenGL. I've posted them here in case someone wants some OpenGL examples.

## Projects

### 01 - Simple triangle

This is the basic of OpenGL, just a triangle.

### 02 - simple triangle organised

The result is the same as the previous one, but the code is organised.

### 03 - Simple texture

I started working on texture. I display a texture on a quad and the quad rotate thanks to a uniform.

Same as the previous one but in 3D.

Use a Compute shader to generate a texture.
